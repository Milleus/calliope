Through our research and testing, the results have shown that these games could activate the brain\u2019s prefrontal areas of older adults during gameplay. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving. Studies have shown that activation of the PFC could potentially improve cognitive performance and function. \n\nUpon completion of each game, the player will be provided feedback on his/her performance through the comparison with other players\u2019 scores in the same age group. On-going research will be conducted to validate the cognitive effects of these games in improving cognitive abilities for daily life activities in older adults.",
