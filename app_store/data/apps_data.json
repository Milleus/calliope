The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving. Studies have shown that activation of the PFC could potentially improve cognitive performance and function. \n\nUpon completion of each game, the player will be provided feedback on his/her performance through the comparison with other players\u2019 scores in the same age group.

Today, more than 5 million people enjoy clean, safe water at a turn of tap. To ensure water sustainability for Singapore increasing water supply alone is not sufficient; managing the demand for water is just as crucial. We must all treat water as a precious resource and make every drop count.\n\nIn line with PUB\u2019s initiative to make water conservation a way of life, the game hopes to encourage adoption of water saving habits. This game starts with a simple one-touch mechanism that enables user to save water in different ways. The first installation of game spreads across 30 levels and 6 backdrops. As the user moves to the other levels, more game mechanisms and game items are included to enhance it. \n\nFor more info on water conservation, please log on to www.pub.gov.sg/conserve",
