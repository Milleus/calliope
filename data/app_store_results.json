These games were developed by researchers from the Centre for Applied Gerontology and students from Temasek Polytechnic (Singapore), in collaboration with renowned neuroscientist Professor Ryuta Kawashima from Tohoku University (Japan). \n\nThere are 6 games which involve memory, attention, logic and arithmetic calculation. Through our research and testing, the results have shown that these games could activate the brain\u2019s prefrontal areas of older adults during gameplay. The prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain is responsible for executive functions such as decision-making and problem-solving. Studies have shown that activation of the PFC could potentially improve cognitive performance and function. \n\nUpon completion of each game, the player will be provided feedback on his/her performance through the comparison with other players\u2019 scores in the same age group. On-going research will be conducted to validate the cognitive effects of these games in improving cognitive abilities for daily life activities in older adults.",

That is why it is important to keep your blood pressure in check regularly!\n\nMain Features:\n- Manual daily entry of blood pressure and pulse rate at any time of the day, or as recommended by the user\u2019s healthcare professional.\n- Records data in daily, weekly and monthly formats, with visual graph to help user monitor his/her blood pressure over time.\n- Share* up to 3 months of user\u2019s blood pressure and pulse rate data to his/her healthcare professional via email, only applicable with user\u2019s consent.\n- Alarm function as reminder to measure blood pressure.\n- Daily health tip on how to better manage blood pressure.\n- Step-by-step guide on how to measure blood pressure correctly.\n\nDisclaimer:\n- BP Matters is a mobile application that is intended to be used as a tool to record and keep track of the user\u2019s blood pressure measurements.
