It is one of the major risk factors for cardiovascular disease and it is a fairly common problem in Singapore. The National Health Survey conducted in 2010 revealed that 23.5% of Singaporeans suffer from high blood pressure, which also means that nearly 1 in 4 Singaporeans are hypertensive.\n\nHigh blood pressure is often called \u201cthe silent killer\u201d as it typically has no symptoms until significant damage has been done to the heart and blood vessels, resulting in many chronic diseases.
